Flower,alyssum - sweet alyssum (tp),1932,johnny's,100,$4.55,8-10 days at 65-70°F (18-21°C),6-8,"Transplant (recommended) - Sow 4-5 weeks before last frost. Transplant out after last frost. Sow several seeds per cell or pot. Do not cover as seeds require light to germinate. Harden off seedlings by growing at 50-55°F (10-13°C) night temperatures. Direct seed - Sow as soon as the soil can be worked. In warmer climates, sow midsummer to late winter for blooms that will last until June. Press seed lightly into surface. Thin when seedlings have first true leaves. Where winter temperatures drop below 28°F (-2°C), sow seeds in spring as soon as the soil can be worked."

Flower,larkspur - qis larkspur formula mix,3350,johnny's,100,$3.10,14-21 days at 55°F (13°C). Chill seed for 7 days at 35°F (2°C) to improve germination.,4-6,"Direct seed (recommended): Sow seeds 1/4"" deep in early spring for summer bloom or in fall for bloom the following year. Darkness is required for germination. Seeds do not germinate well when soil temperatures are above 55°F (13°C). Does best where summers are cool. Larkspur plants require vernalization (a period of cool temperatures) to trigger flower development. Plants should ideally stay above freezing but below 55°F (13°C) for the first six weeks of growth [the ideal temperature during the vernalization period is 50°F (10°C)]. Without exposure to this cold period, the plants will not flower well. Use of crop supports, for example, horizontal trellis, is recommended. Transplant: Grow at 55°F (13°C) until ready to plant outside. Plants have tap roots and do not transplant readily."

Flower,snap dragon - rocket mix,1267,johnny's,100,$4.10,7-14 days at 70-75°F (21-24°C),4-12,"Transplant (recommended) - Sow 8-10 weeks before last frost. Light is required for germination, but a fine layer of vermiculite covering the seeds can maintain moisture levels and prevent algae growth. Bottom water or mist lightly to avoid covering the seed with displaced soil. Transplant to cell packs or larger containers when the first true leaves appear, approximately 3-4 weeks after sowing. If desired, for a bushier plant that produces more flower-producing side branches, pinch young plants back by half their height when plants have formed 4-6 leaves or are approximately 3-4 inches tall. Pinching will delay the crop time by a few weeks. If pinching, space plants 6-12 inches apart. Direct seeding is not recommended."
