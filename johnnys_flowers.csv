Chill seed for 7 days at 35°F (2°C) to improve germination.","Direct seed (recommended): Sow seeds 1/4"" deep in early spring for summer bloom or in fall for bloom the following year. Darkness is required for germination. Seeds do not germinate well when soil temperatures are above 55°F (13°C). Does best where summers are cool. Larkspur plants require vernalization (a period of cool temperatures) to trigger flower development. Plants should ideally stay above freezing but below 55°F (13°C) for the first six weeks of growth [the ideal temperature during the vernalization period is 50°F (10°C)]. Without exposure to this cold period, the plants will not flower well. Use of crop supports, for example, horizontal trellis, is recommended. Transplant: Grow at 55°F (13°C) until ready to plant outside. Plants have tap roots and do not transplant readily.","Sun.","Rich, well-drained, slightly alkaline soil.","4-6"".","Annual.","Fresh: When 2-3 basal flowers are open on up to 1/3 of stem.

Harvesting with the bulb in place (attached to the stem) provides a food source for the tulip during long-term storage. Stand tulips upright or bunch and wrap stems in paper to keep the stems straight in storage.
